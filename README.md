# Intelligent Stock Portfolio Optimization with Dynamic Market Pathfinding

## Overview

This project implements an AI-driven stock portfolio optimization tool that leverages pathfinding algorithms, including A* and Dijkstra's, to dynamically adjust asset allocation based on real-time market data. The system combines advanced algorithms such as Minimax and Dynamic Programming to minimize risk and maximize returns while traversing through potential trading options over time.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Stock Data Integration**: Pulls live stock market data using APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance.
- **Portfolio Path Optimization**: Utilizes pathfinding algorithms to navigate potential buy/sell actions, considering transaction costs and slippage.
- **Risk-Aware Trading**: Integrates the Minimax algorithm to simulate worst-case scenarios and optimize trading decisions under uncertainty.
- **Dynamic Programming for Profit Optimization**: Solves profit maximization problems over multiple transactions, balancing risk and reward across various sectors.
- **Volatility and Correlation Analysis**: Assesses stock correlations and market volatility to inform algorithm behavior for optimal stock selection.


## Current Status

**This project is currently in development.** As of now, only certain features have been implemented. We are actively working on expanding the functionalities, improving algorithms, and enhancing the overall performance of the application.
